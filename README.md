## Description
Super old code base btw, made this in like 2022 or smthn, I just come back to this every now and then to try and make it better with a matured coding style, use cool optimizations, and get better at refactoring code. Also a relatively dense code base with lots of moving parts so its fun to see what you can change and optimize to make it smaller and easy to read since this is defo not easy to read.


Pacman is a classic arcade game developed by Namco in 1980. It has since become one of the most iconic and recognizable video games in history. The game features a yellow, circular character called Pacman, who must navigate through a maze, consuming pellets while avoiding colorful ghosts. This game currently features 5 levels that get progressively harder, try to beat them all!

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate Pacman through the maze.
- The objective is to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts.
- Be careful! If a ghost catches Pacman, you lose.
